### The Idea

It's 8:47am. The coffee line is 15 deep. Your meeting starts at 9. Brewline lets you order your usual from the train, pay in-app, and walk straight to pickup. Plus earn rewards with every coffee — because loyalty should be rewarded.

---

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mobile Ordering** | Order and pay ahead |
| **Customization** | Build your perfect drink |
| **Rewards** | Earn points with every purchase |
| **Find Cafes** | Discover participating locations |
| **ETA** | Know exactly when your order is ready |
| **Stored Payment** | Fast, secure checkout via Stripe |

### Tech Stack

| Expo SDK 54 | React Native framework |
| TypeScript 5.3 | Type safety |
| Redux Toolkit | State management |
| React Navigation | Navigation |
| Stripe | Payment processing |

---

### Design

Warm light theme with coffee brown (`#92400E`) and cream accents — product cards with size options, customization toggles and sliders, order progress tracker, and rewards progress bar.

---

```
